# Lab Report 4
Hello, my name is Nathaniel Jay Petersen, PID: A17832207 and this page will reproduce steps 4-9 of the Vim practice task from lab 7.

## Step 4: Log into ieng6

Keys Pressed: `<up><enter>`

The `ssh napetersen@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was one up in the search history, so I pressed the up arrow to access it. I then ran the command with the enter key, allowing me to access the remote ieng6 server.

## Step 5: Clone the github repo

Keys Pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>` (also typed in a password afterwards)

The `git clone git@github.com:njpetersen/lab7.git` command was seven up in the search history, so I pressed the up arrow seven times to access it. I then ran the command with the enter key, prompting me to enter my password, which I do, allowing the command to clone the forked github repo "lab7" into the current working directory on my ieng6 account.

## Step 6: Demonstrate that the Junit tests fail

Keys Pressed: `<up><up><up><up><up><enter>`,`cd lab7``<enter>`,`<up><up><enter>`

The `bash test.sh command` command was five up in the search history, so I pressed the up arrow five times to access it. I then ran the command with the enter key, but I was in the wrong directory, so the command returned an error. To fix this, I typed in the command `cd lab7` 


up 5 for failure, up 2 for success, cd was typed out

## Step 7:
